"""## Dataset

As you can see in the tittle image of this article, we need to encode both images and their describing texts. So, the dataset needs to **return both images and texts**. Of course we are not going to feed raw text to our text encoder! We will use **DistilBERT** model (which is smaller than BERT but performs nearly as well as BERT) from **HuggingFace** library as our text encoder; so, we need to **tokenize** the sentences (captions) with DistilBERT tokenizer and then feed the token ids (input_ids) and the attention masks to DistilBERT. Therefore, the dataset needs to take care of the tokenization as well. Below you can see the dataset's code. Below that I'll explain the most important things that is happening in the code.

In the **\_\_init\_\_** we receive a tokenizer object which is actually a HuggingFace tokinzer; this tokenizer will be loaded when running the model. We are padding and truncating the captions to a specified max_length. In the **\_\_getitem\_\_** we will first load an encoded caption which is a dictionary with keys input_ids and attention_mask, make tensors out of its values and after that we will load the corresponding image, transform and augment it (if there is any!) and then we make it a tensor and put it in the dictionary with "image" as the key. Finally we put the raw text of the caption with the key "caption" in the dictionary only for visualization purposes.Â 

I did not use additional data augmentations but you can add them if you want to improve the model's performance.

Thinking it in this way, it is similar to what we did to images and converted them into a fixed size vector.

"""## CLIP

This part is where all the fun happens! I'll also talk about the loss function here. I translated some of the code from Keras code examples into PyTorch for writing this part. Take a look at the code and then read the explanation below this code block.

Here we will use the previous modules that we built to implement the main model. The \_\_init\_\_ function is self-explanatory. In the forward function, we first encode the images and texts separately into fixed size vectors (with different dimensionalities). After that, using separate projection modules we project them to that shared world (space) that I talked about previously. Here the encodings will become of similar shape (256 in our case). After that we will compute the loss. Again I recommend reading CLIP paper to get it better but I'll try my best to explain this part.

In **Linear Algebra**, one common way to measure if two vectors are of similar characteristics (they are like each other) is to calculate their **dot product** (multiplying the matching entries and take the sum of them); if the final number is big, they are alike and if it is small they are not (relatively speaking)!

Okay! What I just said is the most important thing to have in mind to understand this loss function. Let's continue. We talked about two vectors, but, what do we have here? We have image_embeddings, a matrix with shape (batch_size, 256) and text_embeddings with shape (batch_size, 256). Easy enough! it means we have two groups of vectors instead of two single vectors. How do we measure how similar two groups of vectors (two matrices) are to each other? Again, with dot product (@ operator in PyTorch does the dot product or matrix multiplication in this case). To be able to multiply these two matrices together, we transpose the second one. Okay, we get a matrix with shape (batch_size, batch_size) which we will call logits. (temperature is equal to 1.0 in our case, so, it does not make a difference. You can play with it and see what difference it makes. Also look at the paper to see why it is here!).

I hope you are still with me! If not it's okay, just review the code and check their shapes. Now that we have our logits, we need targets. I need to say that there is a more straight forward way to obtain targets but I had to do this for our case (I'll talk about why in a next paragraph).

Let's consider what we hope that this model learns: **we want it to learn "similar representations (vectors)" for a given image and the caption describing it. Meaning that either we give it an image or the text describing it, we want it to produce same 256 sized vectors for both.**

"""So, in the best case scenario, text_embeddings and image_embedding matricies should be the same because they are describing similar things. Let's think now: if this happens, what would the logits matrix be like? Let's see with a simple example!"""


"""So logits, in the best case, will be a matrix that if we take its softmax, will have 1.0s in the diagonal (An identity matrix to call it with fancy words!). As the loss function's job is to make model's predictions similar to targets (at least in most cases!), we want such a matrix as our target. That's the reason why we are calculating images_similarity and texts_similarity matrices in the code block above.

Now that we've got our targets matrix, we will use simple cross entropy to calculate the actual loss. I've written the full matrix form of cross entropy as a function which you can see in the bottom of the code block. Okay! We are done! Wasn't it simple?! Alright, you can ignore the next paragraph but if you are curious, there is an important note in that.

**Here's why I didn't use a simpler approach**: I need to admit that there's a simpler way to calculate this loss in PyTorch; by doing this: nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(logits, torch.arange(batch_size)). Why I did not use it here? For 2 reasons. 1- The dataset we are using has multiple captions for a single image; so, there is the possibility that two identical images with their similar captions exist in a batch (it is rare but it can happen). Taking the loss with this easier method will ignore this possibility and the model learns to pull apart two representations (assume them different)  that are actually the same. Obviously, we don't want this to happen so I calculated the whole target matrix in a way that takes care of these edge cases. 2- Doing it the way I did, gave me a better understanding of what is happening in this loss function; so, I thought it would give you a better intuition as well!
