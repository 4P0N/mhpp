1. Dataset cleanup
2. Reindex all the partitions
2A. Use newly generated indexes in step 2 to fully reindex tables in step 1
3.0 Do some manual labor, kick off unnecessary things
	- For schools use one hot encoding
	- For housetypes, use one hot encoding, and kill unnecessary categorical attributes
	- For train stations, add avg_time attribute
3. Make graph (Directed/ Undirected)
	- For house-train stations, already done
	- For train-statoin- train_station, use train_time.csv
	- For house-schools, use 3 km range
	- For train_station-schools, use nearest
	
	
	- For Region- house, already done
4. Make separate files for partition attributes - Kill unnecessary / useless attributes as necessary(feature normalizer)
5. Create a brand spanking new model
